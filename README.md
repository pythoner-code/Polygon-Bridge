# Polygon-Bridge

Here's a suggested outline to complete the tasks you've listed:

1. **Generate a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney:**
   - Use DALLE 2 or Midjourney to generate a collection of 5 unique items. Ensure that the items are visually distinct and interesting.

2. **Store items on IPFS using pinata.cloud:**
   - Upload the generated items to IPFS using Pinata Cloud. This will provide you with IPFS URLs that you can use to reference the items later.

3. **Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet:**
   - Write and deploy a smart contract that implements either the ERC721 or ERC1155 standard on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
   - Include functionality to mint tokens and store metadata (including IPFS URLs) for each token.

4. **Implement a promptDescription function on the contract:**
   - Add a function to your smart contract called `promptDescription` that returns the prompt used to generate the images. This will provide transparency and context for anyone viewing or interacting with your NFT collection.

5. **Map Your NFT Collection using Polygon network token mapper:**
   - Use the Polygon network token mapper to map your NFT collection from Ethereum to Polygon. This step is optional but can be helpful for interoperability and visualization purposes.

6. **Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs:**
   - Create a Hardhat script that allows you to batch mint all 5 NFTs from your collection. Use the ERC721 standard and ensure that each token is minted with the appropriate metadata and IPFS URL.

7. **Write a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge:**
   - Implement a Hardhat script that facilitates the batch transfer of all NFTs from the Ethereum network to the Polygon Mumbai network using the FxPortal Bridge. This script should handle approval, deposit, and confirmation steps.

8. **Approve the NFTs to be transferred:**
   - Before transferring the NFTs, ensure that they are approved for transfer according to the requirements of the FxPortal Bridge.

9. **Deposit the NFTs to the Bridge:**
   - Once approved, deposit the NFTs to the FxPortal Bridge for transfer to the Polygon Mumbai network.

10. **Test balanceOf on Mumbai:**
    - After the transfer process is complete, test the `balanceOf` function on the Polygon Mumbai network to verify that the NFTs have been successfully transferred and are owned by the appropriate addresses.
